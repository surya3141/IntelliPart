## 🔍 Search Types Explained

### 1. **Smart Search** (Recommended)
- Combines AI, keyword, and fuzzy search
- Weighted scoring: AI (50%) + Keyword (30%) + Fuzzy (20%)
- Best balance of accuracy and comprehensiveness

### 2. **AI Search**
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- Great for semantic matching and related concepts
- Finds parts based on meaning, not just exact matches

### 3. **Keyword Search**
- Traditional exact string matching
- Field-weighted scoring (part_name=3x, manufacturer=1.5x, etc.)
- Fast and precise for known terms

### 4. **Fuzzy Search**
- Handles typos and similar words
- Good for exploratory searches
- More forgiving of spelling errors

## 📊 Analytics Features
